Oops - you deleted the "essay" file, which you worked on all night!

Luckily, Git is here to help! You can use `git checkout` to restore the file! Git will restore your last commit even if you deleted it unless you commited.

[setup]

echo important > essay
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
echo "important content" > essay
git commit -am "Improve essay"
rm essay

[win]

# Restore the essay to contain "important content"
test "$(cat essay)" = "important content"
